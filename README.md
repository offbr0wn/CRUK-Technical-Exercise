# CRUK technical exercise (React)

## Task details

- We will be testing your ability to understand an existing React/Typescript codebase, find what is already built, and what is not.
- You will be building a form using the CRUK React Component Library controlled by ReactHookForm which uses a Zod validation schema.
- This form which will fetch items from the NASA Library API. The "Form fields" section below describes the fields and their validation which should modify the search query.
- The media returned should be displayed in list below the form, these may be images, video, or audio clips. It is up to you how you display these
- The user should only see the first 10 items on the page. If you have time enabling pagination is a stretch target.
- Code must be clean and production ready, quality is better than quantity.
- You can test your application with Playwright, see src/test folder for example tests and see all the scripts available in the package.json
- Feel free to edit this readme or add a new readme file for any additional information, such as what you might do improve your application in the future.
- Please do not attempt to push to this repo, please create your own fork.
